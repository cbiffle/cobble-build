Cobble: a simple build system for modular software.
===================================================

Cobble distills my ideas about how to build software -- specifically software
written in C -- into a few hundred lines of Python.

Cobble is currently a work in progress.

Cobble is built on the shoulders of others:

 - [Ninja](http://martine.github.io/ninja/) does all the hard work behind the scenes.
 - The build model was originally dreamed up by [Anton Staaf] in his Make-based build system.
 - Aspects of the design are influenced by [SCons](http://scons.org), [GYP](https://code.google.com/p/gyp/),
   and [GN](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/wiki/gn).

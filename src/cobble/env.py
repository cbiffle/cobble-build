"""Environments and supporting types.

An *environment* in Cobble is an immutable key-value mapping, similar to a
Python dict. The contents of environments are restricted, however, in two ways:

1. Each environment is associated with a `KeyRegistry`, and any key used in the
   environment must be registered before use.

2. The values that can be stored in the environment are different for each key,
   but are generally limited to simple Python data: lists, tuples, sets,
   strings, and booleans.

Cobble targets may produce different build steps in different environments --
for example, a C binary can be built in several different environments, each of
which gives a slightly different value for the `c_flags` key.
